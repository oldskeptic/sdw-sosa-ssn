      <h3>IBS-TH2 Temperature and Humidity Sensor</h3>
      <div>
      <p>This section is a series of examples that represent a IBS-TH2 sensor.  At the time of this publication it is a commercially available consumer grade temperature and humidity sensor.  The sensor is modeled here as a <a href="#SOSAPlatform">sosa:Plaform</a> that <a href="#SOSAhosts">sosa:hosts</a> three different <a href="#SOSASensor">sosa:Sensor</a>s, one measuring air temperature, another air relative humidity and a third for battery health.</p>

      <p>The sensors have operating limits and accuracies that are described in the
literature of the manufacturer.  These values are represented within the
ontology for querying as nominal platform values.  Importantly, the primary
source for these operating values, the manufacturer's literature, is directly
referenced in the <a href="#SOSAProcedure">sosa:Procedure</a>
node of
the description as a means of providing full documentation for the sensor.</p>

<p>The result is a complete ontological description of the IBS-TH2 sensor using
the core Sosa ontology.  As it represents the ontological concept of the
product, they are sub-Classes of the Sosa Classes that are meant to be
instantiated for individual sensors.</p>

<p class="note">This example focuses on the platform, its sensor and their performance. The Bluetooth data-link is not documented
here. Furthermore, while in both vernacular and marketing speech the IBS-TH2 is referred to as a &quot;Sensor&quot;, we use the word
<i>Platform</i> to align to Sosa nomenclature.</p>

<p>The ability to encode sensor operating characteristics and limitations as part of its ontological definition is <b>not</b>
redundant even when linking to a manufacturer's data sheet.  Its availability in a machine readable mark-up allows for tight
integration with sophisticated data consumers that can evaluate data quality and predict performance based on nominal sensors
limits. A direct use case is the problem of software libraries reporting numbers with an impossible number of decimal digits due to
internal binary representations. The sensor accuracy properties can be used to truncate these numbers at the appropriate significant
digit.</p>

<p>Lastly, the encoding of performance and behavior data in a machine readable way is of significant use when selecting <a
href="#SOSAPlatorm">sosa:Platform</a>s for specific tasks: a working set of <a href="#SOSAPlatorm">sosa:Platform</a>s responsive to
the problem specifications can be queried directly.  The use of SOSA to describe the <a href="#SOSAPlatorm">sosa:Platform</a>s
concurrently with commercial availability vocabularies such as schema.org or GS1 Webvoc would be greatly useful for computer-aided
manufacturing and sourcing.</a>

        <p>Note that because the IBS-TH2 is instantiated, so are all of the hosted <a href="#SOSASensor">sosa:Sensor</a>s on the <a
href="#SOSAPlatform">sosa:Platform</a>.  While this seems redundant at face value, these instances represent the actual physical
sensors on that specific physical platform instance along with their performance idiosyncrasies due to manufacturing variance,
defects, configuration, or outright wear and tear.  This makes it possible to record device-level deviations from expected nominal
performance and perform deployment analyses on, for example, battery life performance of individual battery lots.</p>

    <h3>Tracking Beer temperature</h3>

    <p>An RDF file containing a <a
            href="https://github.com/w3c/sdw/blob/gh-pages/ssn/integrated/informativeExamples/InkBird-IBS-TH2-instance.ttl">graph corresponding to

    <div>
     <p>The following is a detailed example where a IBS-TH2 sensor is used to monitor a crate (carton) of beers from the time of its
     packaging at a brewery up until its display in the supermarket cooler where it is ready to be purchased.  Beer degrades both
     at high and low temperatures.  This requires that it be kept cool during storage and shipping to preserve the
     product. Humidity has no effect the beer owing to sealed containers through excess humidity will weaken cardboard and degrade
     the adhesives potentially resulting in product breakage.  Brewers will on occasion insert a temperature logger into
     their shipping process as part of their quality control program and we present such a hypothetical situation here.<p>

     <p>This example is of interest because it involves the repurposing of a commodity, consumer-grade <a
     href="#SOSAPlatform">sosa:Platform</a> to a domain specific problem, the movement of a platform from environment to
     environment and the possible ambiguity of data-ownership in each of these environments. It also demonstrates the location 
     ambiguity that can sometimes be present in modeling sensor readings.</p>

     <p class="note">The use of long identifiers is made for readability purposes and is non-normative.</p>

     <p>Alice works for Acme Brewery Co., she procures an InkBird IBS-TH2 Platform (Serial Number: 12345) and places it inside a beer carton with six
     bottles (a &quot;six-pack&quot;) of Acme Brewery's famous Porter beers with a product lot code of PO202402. She seals the packaging and places it inside of Acme
     Brewery's cooler while awaiting shipment.</p>
     <p>We make use of [[[prov-o]]] as a mechanism to model the packaging activity and the placement of the Platform into the
     crate before it is sealed. The platform is thus monitoring the ambient air temperature and the relative humidity from within
     the beer crate every few minutes. In the following snippet we instantiate both the IBS-TH2 Platform, the carton and the

   <p>In the above example the concurrent use of the <a href="#SOSAhasFeatureOfInterest">sosa:hasFeatureOfInterest</a> and <a
   href="#SOSAhasUltimateFeatureOfInterest">sosa:hasUltimateFeatureOfInterest</a> properties is made to account for the repurposing of a generic
   sensor. The actual measurement being performed by the platform is the air temperature within the carton as a proxy for the beer
   temperature within each beer vessel. Modeling the full thermodynamics activity relating one measurement to the other is beyond the
   scope of this document but could be implemented as a second order &quot;virtual&quot; <a href="#SOSASensor">sosa:Sensor</a> or a
   sophisticated <a href="#SOSAProcedure">sosa:Procedure</a>. Thus the use of the <a href="#SOSAhasUltimateFeatureOfInterest">sosa:hasUltimateFeatureOfInterest</a> property allows for flexibility in the interpretation of the measurement
   within a context <i>not necessarily intended by the original sensor design itself</i>.</p>
   
   <p>Physically, both &lt;12345/HumiditySensor&gt; and &lt;12345/TemperatureSensor&gt; are monitoring the ambient air within the
   specific Porter carton which we define as &lt;10/PO202402/21/0001/acmePorterSixPackAirSample&gt; which resolves the issue of the
   location of the measurement when the carton itself is in motion. The <a href="#SOSAhasUltimateFeatureOfInterest">sosa:hasUltimateFeatureOfInterest</a> property
   then targets the beer temperature within that carton and the humidity the cardboard of the carton was subject to.</p>
   
   <pre># We define this as the beer temperature, but ontologically it is a 
# generic definition for the temperature of the sample.

   <p>The Sosa ontology takes a &quot;feature and property&quot; approach that is then referenced by observations. The
   feature of interest, in this case the ambient air within the carton (&lt;10/PO202402/21/0001/acmePorterSixPackAirSample&gt;) is
   the feature that the Platform is concerned with. However, it really is a proxy for both the temperature of the beer within the
   individual containers (&lt;10/PO202402/21/0001/acmePorterSixPackBeerSample&gt;) within the carton and the relative humidity that
   the packaging (&lt;0001/ProductPackaging&gt;) is being exposed to. The beer &quot;sample&quot; in this case is virtual; the node
   serves only to semantically link the observation to the beer liquid itself without any physical sample being taken. A more
   detailed example with physical beer samples is listed in [[[#beerCollections]]].</p>

    <p>The sensors of the platform are reporting values for the same properties of the same features of interest; the physical
    location of the carton of beer does not effect the process because the platform monitors the inside of the carton itself. Modeling
    its location and the process of (un)loading of the carton from the truck is done through other rdf nodes.</p> 
    <p>The truck on-board monitoring system does report a GPS geometry as a Location. This is the location at which the data was
    recorded from the platform. It is conceivable that the geometry node is shared with a vehicle tracking system rdf representation
    or the vehicle's delivery scheduling application but it is not mandated by Sosa.</p> 

     <p class="note">Locations of Platform, Sensors, and measured samples are often conflated in
     non-semantically enabled systems and the semantics often implicitly assumed by the application. The deep semantic modeling
     within Sosa makes no such implicit assumptions and locations can be assigned to all elements independently.</p>

      <h4>Recording data and sensor tasking through sensor deployments</h4>
      
      <p>Sosa provides a notion of a <a href="http://www.w3.org/ns/sosa/Deployment">Deployment</a> class. This permits the tasking
      or installation of sensors to different environments, purposes, locations or
      leasees. Intended to link Platforms to System this allows the application of different semantics to different situations,
      for example by recording different configuration parameters, thought deployments may be concurrent. Reusing the example of [[[#beerTemp]]], the sensor can be seen to be concurrently deployed within the
      beer carton and multiple coolers / storage sites:</p>

      <p>Sosa provides a lightweight capability to aggregate members for convenience. In previous examples observations where
      clustered according to Deployment or recording Activity. In some circumstances it is useful to aggregate observations
      according to an ad-hoc classification, here following the location storage of the carton while dispensing with geospatial
      data:</p>
      
      <pre>#All data from the carton

    <p>A similar class <a href="http://www.w3.org/ns/sosa/SampleCollection">sosa:SampleCollection</a> allows for the aggregation of <a
    href="http://www.w3.org/ns/sosa/Sample">sosa:Sample</a>s, for example as part of a collection of samples taken as part of a
    quality assurance program. In the case of Amce Brewery, a collection of beer samples could be represented in this manner:</p>
