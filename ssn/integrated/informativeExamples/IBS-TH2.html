      <h3>IBS-TH2 Temperature and Humidity Sensor</h3>
      <div>
      <p>This section is a series of examples that represent a IBS-TH2 sensor.  At the time of this publication it is a commercially available consumer grade temperature and humidity sensor.  The sensor is modeled here as a <a href="#SOSAPlatform">sosa:Plaform</a> that <a href="#SOSAhosts">sosa:hosts</a> three different <a href="#SOSASensor">sosa:Sensor</a>s, one measuring air temperature, another air relative humidity and a third for battery health.</p>

      <p>The sensors have operating limits and accuracies that are described in the
literature of the manufacturer.  These values are represented within the
ontology for querying as nominal platform values.  Importantly, the primary
source for these operating values, the manufacturer's literature, is directly
referenced in the <a href="#SOSAProcedure">sosa:Procedure</a>
node of
the description as a means of providing full documentation for the sensor.</p>

<p>The result is a complete ontological description of the IBS-TH2 sensor using
the core Sosa ontology.  As it represents the ontological concept of the
product, they are subClasses of the Sosa Classes that are meant to be
instantiated for individual sensors.</p>

<p class="note">This example focuses on the platform, its sensor and their performance. The Bluetooth data-link is not documented
here. Furthermore, while in both vernacular and marketing speech the IBS-TH2 is referred to as a &quot;Sensor&quot;, we use the word
<i>Platform</i> to align to Sosa nomenclature.</p>

        <p>Note that because the IBS-TH2 is instantiated, so are all of the hosted <a href="#SOSASensor">sosa:Sensor</a>s on the <a href="#SOSAPlatform">sosa:Platform</a>.  While this seems initially
redundant, these instances represent the physical sensors on that specific physical platform along with
their performance idiosyncrasies due to manufacturing variance,
defects or outright wear and tear.  This makes it possible to record device-level inaccuracies, limitations as well as tracking the
battery life performance of individual battery lots.</p>

    <h3>Tracking Beer temperature</h3>

    <p>An RDF file containing a <a
            href="https://github.com/w3c/sdw/blob/gh-pages/ssn/integrated/informativeExamples/InkBird-IBS-TH2-instance.ttl">graph corresponding to

     <p>The following is a full example where a BS-TH2 sensor is used to monitor a crate (carton) of beers from the time of its
     packaging at a brewery up until its display in the supermarket cooler where it is ready to be purchased.  Beer degrades both
     at high and low temperatures.  This requires that it be kept cool during storage and shipping to preserve the freshness of the
     product.  Humidity has no effect the beer owing to sealed containers through excess humidity will weaken cardboard and break
     down it's adhesives, potentially resulting in product breakage.  Brewers will on occasion insert a temperature logger into
     their shipping process as part of their quality control program and we present such a hypothetical situation here.<p>

     <p>This use case is of interest because it highlights the repurposing of a consumer-grade platform to a domain specific problem,
     the movement of a platform from environment to environment and the possible ambiguity of data-ownership in each of these
     environments.</p>

     <p>Alice works for Acme Brewery Co., she procures an InkBird IBS-TH2 Platform (Serial Number: 12345) and places it inside a beer carton with six
     bottles (a &quot;six-pack&quot;) of Acme Brewery's famous Porter beers with a product lot code of PO202402. She seals the packaging and places it inside of Acme
     Brewery's cooler while awaiting shipment.</p>
     <p>We make use of [[[prov-o]]] as a mechanism to model the packaging activity and the placement of the Platform into the
     crate before it is sealed. The platform is thus monitoring the ambient air temperature and the relative humidity from within
     the beer crate every few minutes. In the following snippet we instantiate both the IBS-TH2 Platform, the carton and the
     activity that represents the packaging of the beer and the creation of the beer carton as a product:<p>

   <p>In the above example the concurrent use of the <a href="#SOSAhasFeatureOfInterest">sosa:hasFeatureOfInterest</a> and <a
   href="#SOSAhasUltimateFeatureOfInterest">sosa:hasUltimateFeatureOfInterest</a> properties is made to account for the repurposing of a generic
   sensor. The actual measurement being performed by the platform is the air temperature within the carton as a proxy for the beer
   temperature within each container. Modeling the full thermodynamics activity relating one measurement to the other is beyond the
   scope of this document but can be implemented as a second order &quot;virtual&quot; <a href="#SOSASensor">sosa:Sensor</a> or a
   sophisticated <a href="#SOSAProcedure">sosa:Procedure</a>. Thus the use of the <a href="#SOSAhasUltimateFeatureOfInterest">sosa:hasUltimateFeatureOfInterest</a> property allows for flexibility in the interpretation of the measurement
   within a context <i>not necessarily intended by the original sensor design itself</i>.</p>

   <p>An issue is whether the complexity incurred in recording measurements in this way is an additional burden on consumers of the
   data. Previous approaches to data storage had an observation centric approach that was partially dictated by relational
   databases. The Sosa ontology takes a &quot;thing and property&quot; approach that is then referenced by observations. This
   approach aligns well to both ontological and object oriented methodologies: Based on a thing, the individual beer carton product (&lt;PO202402/acmePorterSixPack&gt;)
   and the specific property wanted, the (&lt;BeerTemperature&gt;) one can find the specific identifier for the property of that
   specific product which in then referenced by multiple <a href="#SOSAObservation">sosa:Observation</a>s. It also permits the
   seamless querying of direct measurement sensors through the <a href="#SOSAhasFeatureOfInterest">sosa:hasFeatureOfInterest</a>
   property and indirect measurements through <a href="#SOSAhasUltimateFeatureOfInterest">sosa:hasUltimateFeatureOfInterest</a>
   properties.</p>

      <figcaption>The beer carton is being moved from the brewery to the retail location.</figcaption> 
      </figure> 
      <p>After being
     chilled in the brewery cooler, the beer carton is then loaded on one of the Acme delivery trucks for shipment to the retail
     store.  The truck's cooling management system is recording the sensor readings for both the shipping company and the brewery.
     An on-board GPS unit is annotating the activity of recording observations as the truck moves from location to location. This
     position information represents the location of the shipping truck itself without making reference to the beer carton or the
     platform generating the readings. This is important in that the underlying properties and features have not changed, even
     through the beer carton and the platform have obviously changed physical location.</p>

     <p class="note">An important issue in Sosa modeling is that the previous notion of Sensor, Platform and Measurement locations are not always
     aligned with those of everyday vernacular descriptions or of the implicit design decision of non-semantically enabled systems.
     Previous approaches, lacking the notion of property and features,  would often conflate the location of both sensor location and reading
     location. The result is that notions of location and deployment need to be carefully examined during design to ensure clear
     communication with data consumers.</p>
