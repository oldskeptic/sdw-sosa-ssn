<h3>Basis of a chain of samples</h3>
<p>
    Many observation workflows rely on a chain of samples, each making a sub-sample of the predecessor sample.
    Knowing either the original sample or the initial feature of interest at the base of the chain is often useful
    for both discovery and management purposes.
    For example, <a href="#fig-sample-chain-geology"></a> shows a scenario from geology involving many samples
    derived from an initial one, with some relationships that may be useful in processing and discovery of
    subsequent observations, the intention of which will be to characterize various aspects of the original sample
    which is representative of an ultimate feature of interest.
    This is supported by additional properties</a> for relationships between samples and features of interest at
    specific points in the chain:
    <a href="#SOSAhasOriginalSample">hasOriginalSample</a> and <a href="#SOSAhasSampledFeature">hasSampledFeature</a>.

    <figcaption>It is common to generate a chain of samples in a geology exploration scenario, with initial sample
        retrieval from the field followed by a sequence of sampling steps (pink) to generate a series of
        sub-samples (light green).

<p>
    Having a direct indication of an <em>original sample</em> allows multiple results to be combined to describe the sample.
    Having a direct indication of the <em>ultimate feature</em> that was sampled allows discovery of many samples that are
    intended to be representative of that feature.

<p class="Note">Note that the scenario in <a href="#fig-sample-chain-geology"></a> is simplified from real-life
    scenarios, and also that the diagram only shows a subset of the full set of resources and relationships.</p>
